üöß **Under Active Development** üöß

Also note that this tool was created with ChatGPT.

**MTCGen** is a MIDI‚Äëeffect VST3 plugin built with JUCE that lets you map individual MIDI notes to preset start timecodes, then generates synchronized MIDI Timecode (MTC) streams - either Full SysEx or Quarter‚ÄëFrame - when those notes play. Perfect for driving light‚Äëshow consoles, external recorders, or any device that accepts MIDI Timecode.


## Features

- **MIDI‚ÄëNote‚ÜíTimecode Mapping**  
  Define any number of mappings between MIDI notes and base timecodes (HH:MM:SS:FF).

- **Manual ‚ÄúSet Start‚Äù Detection**  
  Capture the exact host time for each note‚Äëon with one click.

- **Multi‚ÄëFormat Output**  
  Choose between standard Full SysEx MTC or high‚Äëresolution Quarter‚ÄëFrame messages.

- **Selectable MIDI Outputs**  
  Send your Timecode stream to one or more physical or virtual MIDI ports.

- **Adjustable Frame Rate**  
  Support for 24, 25, 29.97, and 30 fps.

- **Persistent State**  
  Mappings, labels, frame rate, and selected format/ports are saved and restored via XML.

## Requirements

- [JUCE 7.x](https://juce.com/) (tested with 8.0.7)  
- C++17‚Äëcompatible compiler  
- Visual Studio 2022 (Windows) or Xcode 12+ (macOS)  
- Projucer (to open the project and export your IDE solution)

## Building

1. **Clone** this repository.  
2. **Open** `MTCGen.jucer` in the Projucer.  
3. Under **Plugin Characteristics**, ensure **Plugin is a MIDI effect** is checked and disable any audio buses.  
4. **Save** and **Export** your IDE project.  
5. In your IDE, build the **Debug** and/or **Release** target.  
6. Copy the resulting `MTCGen.vst3` into your DAW‚Äôs plugin folder.

## Usage

1. **Load** MTCGen as a MIDI‚Äëeffect in your DAW.  
2. **Add** mappings using the **Add Mapping** button:  
   - Enter a **Label**, choose a **MIDI Note** from the dropdown, and set the **Mapping Timecode**.  
3. Place the corresponding MIDI note in your DAW timeline (or route a controller keyboard).  
4. **Select** your desired **Frame Rate** and **MTC Format** (Full SysEx vs. Quarter‚ÄëFrame).  
5. In **MIDI Outputs**, check the ports you want to drive.  
6. When you trigger a mapped note‚Äëon, the plugin will start streaming MTC from the preset timecode until the note‚Äëoff.

Use a MIDI loopback (e.g. LoopBe1) and a monitor (e.g. TimeCode Monitor) or your lighting console (ChamSys, ETC, etc.) to verify sync.
